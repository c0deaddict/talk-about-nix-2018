* Talk about Nix (2018)

Here are the slides for the talk I gave about Nix at Thursday 6th of
December at Spindle.

The [[https://c0deaddict.github.io/talk-about-nix-2018/][slides]] are generated from [[./index.org][this]] Org file with [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal/][org-reveal]].
If you want to do this yourself you need Emacs and install the
org-reveal package. Then open the =nix.org= file and press =C-c C-e R
R= this will generate the =nix.html= file.

In reveal.js press =s= to open the speaker notes.
